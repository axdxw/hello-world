# hello-world

Yes hello this is like a bomb of splash or maybe more or less or more like that

Fun fact: I do knwo something about that
A seconds passed

I am not bothering you, sorry
Come to fact for life No such thing as truth, gotta be quiet

*Whisper* By telling you i am sinning
I am wronging by telling truths that are lies 
Nothing can be said not even this 
Out of body
"You were using words? That aint even imagination!"
i aint nothing without your imaginations
Not even nothing
Nothing can be said not even this


(I lost it. Literally. But itll come back. (Apologize for the it))
